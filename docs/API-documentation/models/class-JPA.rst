Classes-JPA
===========

Classes JPA are entities. Entity classes are needed to work between the layer services and repositories.
An entity is a lightweight persistence domain object. Typically, an entity represents a table in a relational database,
and each entity instance corresponds to a row in that table. The primary programming artifact of an entity is the entity class,
although entities can use helper classes.

The persistent state of an entity is represented through either persistent fields or persistent properties.
These fields or properties use object/relational mapping annotations to map the entities and entity relationships
to the relational data in the underlying data store.
