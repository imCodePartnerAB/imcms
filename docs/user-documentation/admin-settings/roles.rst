Introduction
------------

ImCMS 6 provides flexible access control. A role is used to classify users and grant them certain permissions.

* **Get password by email** - gives access to recover password by sending confirmation code to email (Login page -> *Forgot password* button).

* **Access to admin pages** - gives access to the *Site Specific* tab and the *Admin page*, but with limitations.
    * No access to *Ip Access*, *Files*, *Profiles*, *System Properties*, *Index/cache*, *Data-version*, *Documentation* tabs.
    * *Users* tab - a user with this permission cannot edit superadmins and doesn't see them when searching. Also, a such user cannot give the *Superadmin* role when creating/editing.

* **Access to document editor** - gives access to the *Document Manager*. But only the user with the necessary document permission (*EDIT* or *Edit doc info*, see below) can open the *Page Info* of a specific document.

* **Publish own created documents** - the user can publish own documents.

* **Publish all documents (only with EDIT-permission)** - the user can publish any document if he has EDIT permission for the document.

When we view roles with *document editor* permission it have an additional **Document editor** button.
