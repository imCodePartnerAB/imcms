Introduction
------------

The *Document Manager* displays all documents sorted by date modified.
You can change the order and sorting by clicking on the heading of a column.
Besides, you can change the search results by entering some free text, selecting the owner of the document
or the category which the document should have (take a look at the fields above the table).

.. warning:: The user may not be able to see all documents due to lack of permissions. Also a document may be search disabled.
             How permissions affect you can read in the article :doc:`Access Control</user-documentation/access-control>`.
