Content editors
===============

Editors are used to change the content on the page. You have to go to the *Edit mode* to see the available editors.
You can get to the *Edit mode* via the :doc:`Admin Panel </user-documentation/admin-panel>` (**Edit** button)
or via ``<domain-name>/servlet/AdminDoc?meta_id=<id>``.

.. note:: The developer can create content on the page that will be outside editors, such content cannot be changed.

There are 4 types of content on the page that we can edit: *text*, *image*, *menu*, *loop*.

A *loop* is a cycle of one or more combined content types.
For example, 5 times display different images on the left and different texts on the right.
