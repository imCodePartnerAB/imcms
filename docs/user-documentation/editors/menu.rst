* **Alphabetical (Z-A)** - alphabetical sorting by title from Z to A.

* **Published (old first)** - sorting by publication date from oldest to latest.
* **Changed (new first)** - sorting by date modified from latest to oldest.

We can manage menu items using numbers or by dragging the items while sorting manually.
