What can you do:

* Allow to write text around the image.
    The text editor gives you the option to use an image editor internally. You can allow text to write text around the image. There is an usage example below

    +--------------------------------------------------------+
    + .. image:: _static/editor/advanced-text-alignment.png         +
    +--------------------------------------------------------+
    + .. image:: _static/editor/advanced-text-alignment-example.png +
    +--------------------------------------------------------+

* **Specify the coordinates at which the image will be cropped.**
* **Select the format in which the image will be saved.**
* Cancel the image compression process.
    Image compression reduces the size of the image, so image will take up less disk space and load faster on the page.
    Compression can sometimes degrade quality.
* View exif information.
    Exif info - information commenting on the file, describing the conditions and methods for obtaining it, authorship, etc.
