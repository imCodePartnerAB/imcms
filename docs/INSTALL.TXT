Installing imCMS:


Prerequisites:

    * Install the Java Development Kit version 1.5 or later.

    * Install Apache Tomcat 4 or later,
      or another servlet-api 2.3 (or later) compatible servlet engine.

    * Install Microsoft SQL Server 2000, or MySQL 4.1 or later.


Installing imCMS:

    * Rename the file "imcms-<version>.war" to "imcms.war",
      and install it in the "tomcat/webapps" directory.

    * Start Tomcat.
      Tomcat will find the war-file you installed, 
      and unpack it into a directory named after the war-file, "tomcat/webapps/imcms".


Setting up the database:

    * Create a new database on your database server, as appropriate for your type of database server
      and your preferred default language.

    Example:

        To create a MySQL database, a command like the following might be appropriate:

            mysql -u <user> -p -e "CREATE DATABASE imcms CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_swedish_ci"
           
        On Microsoft SQL Server you can use "Enterprise Manager" to create a database,
        or use "SQL Query Analyzer" to execute something like the following SQL command:
         
            CREATE DATABASE imcms COLLATE Finnish_Swedish_CI_AS

        See the documentation for your database server for details.
  

Setting up imCMS:

    * Edit the file "server.properties" in the directory "tomcat/webapps/imcms/WEB-INF/conf",
      and set the database parameters ("JdbcDriver", "JdbcUrl", "User", "Password", "MaxConnectionCount")
      according to your setup.
      Set "SmtpServer" to the hostname of your SMTP (outgoing mail) server.

    * If you want to add a file-extension to be recognized as a mime-type by imCMS,
      add a "<mime-mapping>" to "tomcat/webapps/imcms/WEB-INF/web.xml".
      See http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/ for the mime-type registry.

    * Restart Tomcat to reload the settings.
    

Running:

    * Try logging in at " http://localhost:8080/imcms/login/ " as user "admin" with password "admin".
      (Replace "localhost:8080" with whatever hostname and port your servlet engine is running on.)

    * The database configured in "server.properties" will be automatically set up,
      which might take from a few seconds to a minute or so.
      This only happens the first time you run imCMS. 
      
    * When the database setup is finished you should see the welcome page.


You're done!
